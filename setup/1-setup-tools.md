# BareMetal-C Tool Setup for Windows / macOS

## 0. Conventions, guidelines, and WSL preparation
### Conventions:
This is what you should type or copy & paste into computer (example):

```
type, copy & paste, or take action. 
```

and if you see a vertical line **`|`** to the left of a box,
the text in the box with **`|`** on the left is the output from the computer (example):

> `I am the output from the computer`

- **Windows:** contains specific Windows only information.
- **macOS:** contains specific macOS only information.

---

### Guidelines:

**Windows and macOS:**

We *strongly* recommend you to **create a new *administrator level* user** for this class. Some of the software can run more easily.

For the new *username, DO NOT use space* in the name. Example: `JanDoeII` is good, while `Jan Doe II` is bad.

---

Now that you have created a new user:

- Choose the folders we recommend; their full path name has no `space`.
- We will support you *only if* you use `Documents` folder:
  - **Windows location:**

    > `C:\Users\NAME\Documents\BareMetal-C`

  - **macOS location:**

    > /Users/NAME/Documents/BareMetal-C

---

### WSL prepartion (Windows only):
  Click `Windows start button` and type:

  ```
  turn windows features on or off
  ```
  
  Run it. Scroll down and check ✔

  `☑ Windows Subsystem for Linux`

  and click OK.

  Reboot if necessary.

  **Check your current WSL version:**
  - Type `Win+R` and run `cmd` or `powershell` and type:

    ```
    wsl --version
    ```
  
  - If it says `WSL version: 2.x.x`, you're ok.
    
    But if it is `1.x.x`, you must update `WSL` to `WSL2` by:
  
    ```
    wsl --update
    ```
  
    Reboot.

    After reboot, do `wsl --version` again to check that you are on `WSL version: 2.x.x`.

## 1. (Windows & macOS) Install GitHub Desktop

- Download GitHub desktop from [GitHub desktop page](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

- Run it. You don't need to sign up, but you need to provide an email address and name. It's best that you *do not share the same email address* with friends. It can cause problems later.

- From **File** menu, click **Clone a repository from the internet** and select **URL**.

- Before cloning the following URL:

  ```
  https://github.com/kongkrit/BareMetal-C
  ```

- For **Windows & macOS:** Use `Documents` folder. **Read carefully:**

  - *GitHub Desktop* will try to foce you to use `Documents/GitHub` folder. **Override** it!

  - **Windows:** Use *local path* `C:\Users\NAME\Documents\BareMetal-C`

  - **macOS:** Use *local path* `/Users/NAME/Documents/BareMetal-C`

  The screenshot below is for username `dev`:

  ![github desktop folder](./pix/1-github-folder.png)

- Click `Clone` and wait for it to finish. Now everything resides in `Documents/BareMetal-C` folder.

---

## 2. (Windows & macOS) Install Docker Desktop 

- Make sure you have *admin rights* on your computer. That is, you can install new programs for all users, etc.

- Make sure you don't have anything important running. `Docker Desktop` may force you to log out to complete the installation.

- Download `Docker Desktop` from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

  Click *Download Docker Destop* and choose the drop down that matches your computer's CPU:

  - **Windows:** Choose `Windows AMD64`

  - **macOS with M-series chip** (starting in late 2020): `Mac - Apple Silicon`

  - **Older macOS with Intel CPU** (before late 2020): `Mac - Intel Chip`

- Install `Docker Desktop` and `Accept` Docker Subscription Service Agreement. It's free for personal use.

---

  ### For Windows:

  - Make sure the following box is **checked ✔. We will use `WSL2`**:

    > `☑ Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V`

  - and we recommend you **not** to install Windows containers:

    > `☐ Allow Windows Containers to be used with this installation`

  - `Add shortcut to desktop` choice is totally up to you.

  - **Afer installation, it will force you to log out.** Just log back in.

  - You can skip all the questions

---

  ### For macOS:
  - Drag and drop `Docker` into your `Applications` folder

  - Run `Docker` and select `Use recommended settings`

  - You can skip all the questions

  - Accept all the permissions

  - Wait for the docker icon (a whale with containers on top) on menu bar to stop dancing.

---

  ### For both Windows / macOS:

  - `Accept` Docker Subscription Service Agreement. It's free for personal use.
  
  - Select `Personal`, not `Work`, and you can skip giving out your email address.
  
  - You're free to `Skip` answering all other questions as well.
  
  - **Make sure you get to the `Docker Desktop` main window.** It should have tabs on the left side, like: `Containers`, `Images`, `Volumes`, etc.
  
  - **Automatically start `Docker Desktop`** every time you start your computer:

    ![docker desktop](./pix/1-docker-desktop.png)

    - On `Docker Desktop` main window, on the upper right bar, click `⚙ (gear icon)` for settings, then click `General` tab on the left. We recommend:

    > ```
    > ☑ Start Docker Desktop when you sign in to your computer
    > ☐ Open Docker Dashboard when Docker Destop starts
    > ```

  - Click `Apply` on the bottom right to save settings.
  
  - You can close `Docker Desktop` main window now.

---

## 3. Pull the course software container
Windows and macOS instructions are a bit different here.

### For Windows:
- Click Start Menu and type `powershell`. Hit enter. A new window opens with prompt:
  
  > `PS C:\WINDOWS\system32>`

- Copy and paste the following:
  
  ```
  cd "$HOME\Documents\BareMetal-C"; if ($?) { docker run --rm -v "${PWD}\.vscode:/target" ghcr.io/kongkrit/baremetal-c cp -r /usr/share/sdcc/include /target/sdcc-include }; if ($?) { Write-Host "`nSetup Complete" -ForegroundColor Green }
  ```

  Wait a while, and you should get message:

  > `Setup Complete`

### For MacOS

- Open `terminal` app:

- At the prompt, copy and paste the following:
  
  ```
  cd ~/Documents/BareMetal-C && docker run --rm -v "${PWD}/.vscode:/target" ghcr.io/kongkrit/baremetal-c cp -r /usr/share/sdcc/include /target/sdcc-include && printf "\nSetup Complete\n"
  ```

  Wait a while, and you should get message:

  > `Setup Complete`

## 4. Check `sdcc-include`

- Copy and paste the following into prompt:

  ```bash
  ls .vscode/sdcc-include/stdi*.h
  ```
  You should see `stdint.h` and `stdio.h` somewhere in the output.

---

## 5. Try tool command line

- Copy and paste the command below into **Windows Powershell** or **macOS terminal**:

  ```bash
  docker run --name baremetal-c --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/BareMetal-C ghcr.io/kongkrit/baremetal-c
  ```

- Your prompt will change to:

  > ```
  > Welcome to student BareMetal-C Environment
  > 0.4.1 2026-01-01 19:22:39+0700
  > [student]:/BareMetal-C #
  > ```

  If you get the above prompt, your installation is successful.

- From now on, we will call `[student]:/BareMetal-C #` the **tool prompt**.

---

## 6. Test the tools (same for Windows and macOS)

Type all the commands from the **tool-prompt**:

### Check `sdcc` `z80dasm` and `make` -- all from **tool-prompt**:

Check `sdcc`:

```bash
sdcc --version
```

It should say: `SDCC : mcs51/z80/.../f8 TD- 4.5.0 #15242 (Linux)`

Check `sdasz80`:

```bash
sdasz80 2>&1 | head -n 3
```

It should say: `sdas Assembler V02.00 + NoICE + SDCC mods  (Zilog Z80...)`

Check `z80dasm`:

```bash
z80dasm -V
```

It should say: `z80dasm, Z80 assembly language generating disassembler...`

Check compilation:

We use `make` to build our C programs.

```bash
make DIR='_test_setup' RECURSE=0
```

and it should say (not exactly, but very similar):

> ```
>   ...
>   NON_HANDLER_OBJ - _test_setup/blinking_running_led.rel
>   HANDLER_OBJ     -
>   STARTUP_OBJ     - _defaults/startup_no_int.rel
>   MEMMAP          - _defaults/memmap.ld
> -b _CODE = 0x0100
> -b _DATA = 0x4200
> -g _STACK_TOP = 0xC000
> 
> sdcc -mz80 --no-std-crt0 _defaults/startup_no_int.rel  _test_setup/blinking_running_led.rel -Wl-u -Wl-f,_defaults/memmap.ld -o _test_setup/_test_setup.ihx
> 
> >> Generating Binary and Disassembly _test_setup.bin and _test_setup.txs...
> sdobjcopy -I ihex -O binary _test_setup/_test_setup.ihx _test_setup/_test_setup.bin
> z80dasm -a -l -t -g0 _test_setup/_test_setup.bin 2> /dev/null > _test_setup/_test_setup.txs
> 2025-12-31 17_13_50 +0700 ------------ built _test_setup.bin ------------
> ```

## 7. Test Clean-up

Go back to the tool prompt and type:

```bash
make clean DIR='_test_setup'
```

and it should say:

>  ```
>     ...
>  >> Cleaning artifacts in code folders (recursive)...
>     cleaning _test_setup
> 2025-12-22 23_33_06 +0700 ------------ clean successful ------------
>  ```

---

### How to logout of the tool prompt.

and get back to `tool-prompt`:

Log out of **tool-prompt**. Easy. type `ctrl + d` or type `exit` and you will see:

> ```
> [student]:/BareMetal-C/code # exit
> exit
> ```

and the prompt changes to `PS C:\...` (Windows), or `name@computername BareMetal-C %` (macOS)

---

## 8. How to get back to the **tool-prompt**:

- Make sure that `Docker Desktop` is running.

- Make sure you're in the correct folder (`BareMetal-C`).

- Repeat steps in section [*5. Try tool command line*](#5-try-tool-command-line) above.

---

## 9. Next Step:

Goto [set up SimulIDE](./2-setup-simulide.md).
